# Particle3D
A set of classes that allow the creation and use of three dimensional vectors and particle objectshe p consisting of two, three dimensional vectors and a double and string field.

The Particle3D objects fields include two 3D vectors for position and velocity, a double for the particles mass and a string corresponding to the particle's label.

Both classes also have additional classes for acting on, and with, the vector or particle object.
